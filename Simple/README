This directory needs a couple things:

Edit the ../../model_mod.f90 to enable the perturbation
routine and rebuild the filter executable.

Copy over the filter and wrf_to_dart executables.

Run wrf_to_dart to create a single filter_ics file.

Then edit the 'runme' script and run.  This test will not
try to do a model advance.
