This directory has the skeleton of a script that increments
a time and does something once an hour.  For the TC obs this
may not be as useful as for some other types of obs, but it
is here as an example.

It might be useful if you want to generate a lot of observations
from different tracks, and then split the observations into
hourly files for assimilating once an hour, or into 3 hour files
for assimilating once every 3 hours.
