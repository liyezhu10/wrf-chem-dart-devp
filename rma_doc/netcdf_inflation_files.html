The filter_nml namelist controls whether state IO is directly from netcdf files or from dart format
files. If direct_netcdf_read/write = .true. Then filter will read/write the model state from netcdf files
and also read/write inflation from netcdf files.
<p>
Netcdf inflation files are no longer special files.
DART format inflation files are always 2 copies in one file (mean and standard devation). Taking away this
special status of inflation files has the advantage that all copies (restarts, ensemble mean, ensemble
standard deviation, inflation mean, inflation sd, etc.) can all be treated the same for IO purposes. Since there
are two inflation files when reading/writing netcdf the filenames are different to DART format restart files.

<p>
The names of the netcdf inflation files are constructed from filter_nml options as follows:
<p>
<b>Input inflation file names</b><p>
The filter_nml option:<p>
<code>inf_in_file_name = prior_inflation_ics,   post_inflation_ics</code>
<p>
means for 1 domain filter is expecting to read:
<p>
prior_inflation_mean_ics<br>
prior_inflation_sd_ics
<P>
For multiple domains (or with add_domain_extension = .true.) filter is expecting to
read:
<p>
prior_inflation_ics_mean_d01<br>
prior_inflation_ics_sd_d01<br>
prior_inflation_ics_mean_d02<br>
prior_inflation_ics_sd_d02<br>
<P>
where d0* is the domain number.
<p>
<b>Output inflation file names</b><p>
The filter_nml option:<p>
<code>inf_out_file_name = prior_inflation_restart,    post_inflation_restart</code>
<p>
means for 1 domain filter is expecting to write:
<p>
prior_inflation_restart_mean<br>
prior_inflation_restart_sd
<P>
For multiple domains (or with add_domain_extension = .true.) filter is expecting to
write:
<p>
prior_inflation_restart_mean_d01<br>
prior_inflation_restart_sd_d01<br>
prior_inflation_restart_mean_d02<br>
prior_inflation_restart_sd_d02<br>
<P>
where d0* is the domain number.
