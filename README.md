## wrf_hydro_dart README

This is the GitHub overview of the wrf_hydro_dart repository. 

This is a full copy of the [DART](https://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/) repository (circa Nov 2014) with an addition for *offline* WRF-Hydro. 

1. Offline (uncoupled from WRF) DART with WRF-Hydro: models/wrfHydro
2. Online  (couple      to WRF) DART with WRF-Hydro: Does not exist.

Currently there is only code for DA(RT) offline WRF-Hydro. We call this "HydroDART" to remove WRF from the name, though it resides in the directory models/wrfHydro (which should probably be renamed at a later date, when coupled DA emerges).

Please see [README](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_dart/blob/master/README) for the DART readme and please see the [enclosed](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_dart/blob/master/index.html) and [on-line](https://www.image.ucar.edu/DAReS/DART/DART_Documentation.php) materials for help with the DART system. 

Specifics to HydroDART reside almost entirely within models/wrfHydro. Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_dart/wiki) for documentation on HydroDART.
