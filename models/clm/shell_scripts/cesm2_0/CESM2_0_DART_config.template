# ---------------------
# Purpose
# ---------------------
#
# This script integrates DART with a pre-existing CESM multi-instance case.
# It must be run from a valid CASEROOT directory. If the case was created
# using one of the DART scripts, this script should be staged in the
# CASEROOT directory automatically, and DARTROOT is set at that time.
#
# CLM is the only active model component.
# CESM starts and stops to allow for CLM to assimilate every 24 hours.
#
# This script will build the DART executables if they are not found.
#
# ---------------------
# How to set up the script
# ---------------------
#
# -- Ensure DARTROOT references a valid DART directory.
# -- Examine the whole script to identify things to change for your experiments.
# -- Provide any initial files needed by your run:
#       inflation
#       sampling error correction
# -- Run this script.
# -- Edit the DART input.nml that appears in the ${CASEROOT} directory.
# -- Submit the job using ${CASEROOT}/${CASE}.submit
#
# ==============================================================================
# Get the environment of the case - defines number of instances/ensemble size ...
# Each model component has their own number of instances.
# ==============================================================================

cd BOGUS_CASEROOT_STRING

# OBSROOT  should reference the stockpile of observation sequence files.
# DARTROOT should reference the base portion of the DART code tree.
# Both of these should be set by the DART CESM setup script.

# Now the script to be run is determined by
# CESM's env_run.xml DATA_ASSIMILATION* variables.
#
# DATA_ASSIMILATION_CYCLES says how many cycles to run in each job before a RESUBMIT.
# Set to 1 for the first cycle.
# When the job (not each cycle) is finished the short_term archiver will run and,
# if RESUBMIT > 0, resubmit a new case.run job.

# INFLATION : Initial setup for the default inflation scenario.
# ==============================================================================
# CLM may use adaptive state-space prior inflation. The initial settings
# are in the filter_nml and ... during an assimilation experiment, the output
# from one assimilation is the input for the next. To facilitate this operationally,
# it is useful to specify an initial file of inflation values for the first
# assimilation step. However, I can think of no general way to do this. The
# utility that creates the initial inflation values (fill_inflation_restart)
# needs the model size from model_mod. To get that, DART/CLM needs
# files which we generally don't have at this stage of the game (it exists after
# a model advance). So ... until I think of something better ... I am making a
# cookie file that indicates this is the very first assimilation. If this
# cookie file exists, the assimilate.csh script will make the inflation restart
# file before it performs the assimilation. After the first assimilation takes
# place, the cookie file must be 'eaten' so that subsequent assimilations do not
# overwrite whatever _should_ be there.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you stage your own inflation file, you must REMOVE the cookie
# file from the RUNDIR directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the DART configuration:

1) The default behavior is to _not_ invoke DART and simply run CESM.
   We recommend that you make sure this works before proceeding.
   ./xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION=FALSE

2) When you want to run DART, turn on data assimilation and call 
   the appropriate script:
   
   cd ${CASEROOT} 
   ./xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION=TRUE

   ./xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION_SCRIPT=${CASEROOT}/assimilate.csh
   -or- 
   ./xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION_SCRIPT=${CASEROOT}/perfect_model.csh

3) Modify what you need to in the DART namelist file, i.e. ${CASEROOT}/input.nml

4) If you have recompiled any part of the DART system, 'stage_dart_files'
   will copy them into the correct places.

5) If you stage your own inflation files, make sure you read the INFLATION section
   in ${CASEROOT}/CESM_DART_config

6) Make sure the observation directory names in 
   ${CASEROOT}/assimilate.csh and/or
   ${CASEROOT}/perfect_model.csh 
   match those on your system.

7) Submit the CESM job in the normal way.

8) You can use ${CASEROOT}/stage_cesm_files
    to stage files to restart a run.
