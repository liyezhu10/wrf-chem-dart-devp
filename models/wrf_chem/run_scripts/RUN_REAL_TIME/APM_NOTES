The following has ADD_EMISS=false and VARLOC=true

Re-run FRAPPE initial for test at 2014072518.  Question is whether wrfchem runs beyond zero hour-forecast.  Problem in preprocess_obs with the TAUAER fields not being in the wrfinput file.  TAUAER fields are said to be in DART state vector but are not in the wrfinput file.  Try a fix in real (does not work).Try removing from state vector for this cycle (remove TAUAER and PM fields).  Problem solved by runningpreprocess with default_state_variables=true.  This run worked. 

PANDA_RETR intitial at 2014072418 worked.  But for the first cycle at 2014072500 wrfchen fails.  

Re-run KORUS_RETR initial at 2016052500 to see if it works.  Problem in wrfchem_initial with the job queue - cannot be exclusive when submitted to geyser (fixed and resubmtted). 

Re-run 2008CASE initial at 2008060106 to see if it works.  This run worked.

The problem with the initial forecast seems to be solved.  The next set of tests is for the first assimilation cycle.
