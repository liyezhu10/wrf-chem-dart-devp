This file contains instructions for building and running the WRF-Chem/DART 
release and test case.

=============================================================================
The WRF-Chem/DART interface has been upgraded to be DART-Manhattan compliant.
Source code, scripts, supporting files have been modified to meet 
Manhattan standards.  
=============================================================================

INTRODUCTION:

The WRF-Chem/DART release is a "cleaned-up" version of my working/development
directories.  As such, it is set up to run the WRF-Chem/DART test case with a
minimum amount of effort: some user changes to adapt the compiler, mathematical 
libraries, and ksh scripts to your local system will be necessary. At present,
the Intel compiler has been tested and there are some routines that require the
Intel Math Kernel Libraries.

Since it is my working directory the distribution includes code that works and
is tested, code that runs but has not been tested, and code that simply does
not work. Once you have the test case running and want to test other features 
of WRF-Chem/DART you should contact me at mizzi@ucar.edu to find out the 
status of those features.

If you have questions about WRF-Chem/DART you should contact me because we do 
not have a Users Guide.  If your questions are more closely related to DART 
you should contact DART support at dart@ucar.edu.  If your question
is more closely related to WRF-Chem/DART, they will pass it along to me.

Once WRF-Chem is built and you are able to run the test case, I suggest you
work through the run script to learn how it is structured and to learn the
steps/tasks that are required for regional ensemble chemical weather
forecasting/data assimilation. Once you understand the flow of the run
script you will be in a position to make modifications and start your
experiments.  Here again, I suggest you discuss your intended modifications
and experiments with me in advance.  This is an unfortunate result of not
having a Users Guide, but it has worked well for the existing users.

FUNDING/SUPPORT:

The WRF-Chem/DART project began in mid-2012 as a cooperative effort at the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) between the Data Assimilation 
Research Section in the Computational Information Systems Labratory (CISL) and 
the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Laboratory (ACOM) based on 
funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA).  In mid-2017, ACOM's support for the project 
ended.  From mid-2018 to early 2020, WRF-Chem/DART was supported by the Colorado 
Department of Public Health and Environment/Air Pollution Control Division 
(CDPHE/APCD), the University of Colorado Department of Mechanical Engineering 
(CU-MECE) and Research Computing Program (CURC), and CISL.  From early 2020 to 
the present WRF-Chem/DART is funded by NASA through the Universities Space Research 
Associates (USRA) at the NASA Ames Researh Center, CU-MEC, CURC, and CISL. In 
addition WRF-Chem/DART contributions have been made by: York University, 
University of California at Berkeley, Nanjing University, University of Colorado, 
and University of Arizona.

TEST CASE DATA:

The test case data for WRF-Chem/DART can be retrieved using the Globus data service. 
If you do not have Globus, you can go here to sign up: https://www.globusid.org.  
Once you are logged into Globus, the files you want are here:

Host Endpoint: NCAR Data Sharing Service
Host Path:     /glade/datashare/nancy/WRF_CHEM_DART_DATA_FILES

There are two files in this directory.  The input files are in FRAPPE_REAL_TIME_
TEST_DATA.tgz, and the output files are in real_FRAPPE_RETR_RELEASE_TEST_Manhattan.tgz.  
These files should be readable by anyone, but be forewarned, they are very large.  
The input files are 67 GB, and the output files are 99 GB (tarred and compressed). 

The test case domain is the western continental United States (CONUS).  It runs the 
Initial Cycle on 12 UTC July 25, 2014 and the First Assimilation Cycle on 18 UTC 
July, 25, 2014.  It assimilates conventional meteorological observations and MOPITT CO 
retrieval profiles as raw retrievals.  The script for running the test case is described 
in Step 7 of the BUILD INSTRUCTIONS section below.  For questions about accessing
the data, please contact dart@ucar,edu.  For questions about the data, please 
contact me at mizzi@ucar.edu.   

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

1. In this discussion "../" refers to your DART home directory.
It assumes that you have DART, WRF-Chem, WPS, and WRFDA built and
running on your system.

2. Go to the "../build_templates" directory, copy the appropriate
"mkmf.template.compiler_type.etc" into "mkmf.template", and modify/adapt
"mkmf.template" to your system.

3. Go to "../models/wrf_chem/work" and run "./quickbuild.csh". If this
step completes successfully, you should have approximately 30 WRF-Chem/DART
executables in this "work" directory.

4. Go to "../observations/obs_converters" and run "./buildall.csh".  This 
will build all the WRF-Chem/DART observation converters.  They convert 
observations from their native format to the DART input format.  If this step 
completes successfully you should have observation converter executables in 
the observation type "work" directories. NOTE: "buildall.csh" is configured to 
build the observation converters commonly used in WRF-Chem/DART.  If you want 
other observation converters, you will need to build them manually or modify 
"buildall.csh" to add them to the build list.

5. Go to "../models/wrf_chem/run_scripts" and run "./buildall.csh".  This
will build the WRF-Chem/DART support utilites.  If this step completes
successfully, you should have WRF-Chem/DART utility executables (indicated by
a ".exe" extension) in the utility "work" directory.  The "buildall.csh" script will
build all the WRF-Chem/DART utility executables existing as of the date of this
release.  However, WRF-Chem/DART does not use all these executables because
some are under development and some are legacy software.

6. Go to "../models/wrfchem/hybrid_scripts" and modify the
"da_run_hold_cu.ksh" and "job_script_summit.ksh" scripts for your system.
The "da_run_hold_cu.ksh" script is used by the run script to test whether all 
ensemble members have finished executing a specific task.  The "job_script_summit.ksh" 
script is the batch job submission script. It has "SERIAL" and "PARALLEL" job submission 
options.  It will likely need to be modified to accomodate your particular job 
scheduler/load manager.

7. Go to "../models/wrf_chem/runs_scripts/RUN_REAL/FINAL_TEST_SCRIPTS" and
edit the "real_time_FRAPPE_RETR_RELEASE_TEST_CU_FULL_INTERACTIONS.ksh" script to run on 
 your system. The is the test case run script.  You will need to edit: 
 (i)   "CODE VERSIONS" variables to match your code version and identifiers; 
 (ii)  "ROOT DIRECTORIES" variables to match the root paths on your system.  
       You should not need to change the "DEPENDENT INPUT DATA DIRECTORIES" variables; 
 (iii) For now, you should not need to change the "SELECT COMPONENT RUN OPTIONS" variables, 
       but remember this section because these switches control the various WRF-Chem/DART
       job tasks; 
 (iv)  You may need to change the "COMPUTER PARAMETERS" to match the options 
       you set in "job_script_summit.ksh" for your particular scheduler/load manager; 
 (v)   You should not need to change the "RUN_DIRECTORIES" variables; and 
 (vi)  Finally, I have found that different machines have different "ksh" implementation 
       quirks.  You will likely need to modify the run script to address differences in
       the "ksh" implementation for your machine.

8. You are now ready to run the first two cycles of the WRF-Chem/DART test
case called "real_FRAPPE_RETR_RELEASE_TEST_Manhattan".  The first cycle is 
called the "Initial Cycle" and the second cycle is called the "First Assimilation Cycle".
There is no data assimilation (i.e., the RUN_DART_FILTER and RUN_UPDATE_BC steps are not 
executed) in the "Initial Cycle". That cycle sets up the initial ensemble and generates the 
initial forecast ensemble.  The "First Assimilaton Cycle" generates an input ensemble to get 
the lateral boundary conditions for the forecast step.  It also collects the relevant 
observations, conducts the ensemble data assimilation (both meteorological and chemical data 
assimilation), updates the lateral boundary conditions to account for changes due to the data 
assimilation, and generates the forecast ensemble. That completes the first two cycles.

9. The date-time string for the Initial Cycle is "2014072512" - that means
July 25, 2014 at 12:00 UTC.  To run the "Initial Cycle" you do not need to change the 
CYCLE_STR_DATE or CYCLE_END_DATE variables.  Also you should not need to change any 
of the "SELECT COMPONENT RUN OPTIONS" options.  To run the "First Assimilation Cycle" you will 
need to change the "CYCLE_STR_DATE" and "CYCLE_END_DATE" to "2014072518" and set "RUN_GEOGRID" 
to "false".

10. When you submit the run_script, it should create the ${SCRATCH_DIR}/real_FRAPPE_RETR_RELEASE_
TEST_Manhattan directory. For a successful run, inside that directory  you should see the following 
directories: "2014072512" and "geogrid".  The 2014072512 directory contains the runtime output 
for the "First Assimilation Cycle" and "geogrid" contains data for creating the WRF input files.  

11. If the "Initial Cycle" completes successfully, you should make the changes described in Step 9 
to run the First Assimilation Cycle.  If your First Assimilaiton Cycle  run is successful, the 
output will be in the 2014072518 directory and should resemble the output in the corresponding 
test case output data directory.

12. There are there are three tests to see whether you have run both cycles successfully.  
For the "Initial Cycle," "cd" to "wrfchem_initial" and do an "ls" on each of the run directories 
"run_e001" to "run_e010".  If usccessful, you will have wrf-chem output "wrfout_d01_2014-07-25_
12:00:00" to "wrfout_d01_2014-07-25_18:00:00" in each directory.  This is the ensemble forecast 
output from the "Initial Cycle."  If you then do a "../cd ensemble_mean_output" and "ls" you 
should have "wrfout_d01_2014072512_mean" to "wrfout_d01_2014072518_mean".  This is the ensemble 
mean forecast output.  If those content of files is the same as for the test case output, the 
"Initial Cycle" run successfully.  There will be no "localization", "dart_filter", or "update_bc"  
directories or associated output because DART is not called during the "Initial Cycle."  For the 
"First Assimilation Cycle" "cd" to "dart_filter" and do a "ncdiff output_mean.nc preassim_mean.nc 
incr.nc" and a "ncview incr.nc".  That will plot the assimilation increments.  They should be the 
same as those from the "incr.nc" file in the test case output.  The do a "../cd wrfchem_cycle_cr" 
and an "ls" the run directories (this directory is analogous to the "wrfchem_initial" directory 
for the "Initial Cycle."  Then do a "../cd ensemble_mean_output" and "ls" you should have 
"wrfout_d01_2014072518_mean" to "wrfout_d01_2014072600_mean".  If those content of files is the 
same as for the test case output, the "First Assimilation Cycle" run successfully

Thank you for using WRF-Chem/DART.  Good luck!
