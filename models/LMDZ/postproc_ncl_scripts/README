This directory contains following shell script and ncl codes for Postprocessing of Posterior.c and Prior.nc files
resulting from sequential assimilation with LMDZ.

run_extract_state_vectors.csh
extract_state_vectors_ens_mean_ml_to_pl.ncl 
extract_state_vectors_spread_ml.ncl
extract_state_vectors_ens_mean_ml.ncl  
extract_state_vectors_inf.ncl
extract_state_vectors_spread_ml_to_pl.ncl


use 'run_extract_state_vectors.csh' script  to extract

      (1) Mean state vectors (T,U,V,Q,ps,CDLIQ)  on A-grid and press levs from C-grid and model levs
          using extract_state_vectors_ens_mean_ml_to_pl.ncl 

      (2) State Vectors inflation on A-grid and model levs
          using extract_state_vectors_inf.ncl

      (3) State Vectors  spread on A-grid and press levs
          using extract_state_vectors_spread_ml.ncl 

Others two ncl scripts 'extract_state_vectors_ens_mean_ml.ncl'  and 'extract_state_vectors_spread_ml.ncl' 
can be used to extract Mean state vectors and their Spreads, respectively on model levels.
