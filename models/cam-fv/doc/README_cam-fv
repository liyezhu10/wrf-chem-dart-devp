We recommend that, before using the cam-fv interface,
you become familiar with DART by working through 
the core parts of the tutorial or getting instruction 
from someone knowledgable about DART.

The scripts which set up CAM and/or assimilations are in
shell_scripts/cesm2_0 (as of 2018-6). 
Work through setup_hybrid, which will guide you 
through setting up the multi-instance CAM-FV environment 
which DART requires.
That script includes instructions for activating the 
assimilation using DART_config.template.
Do check the output of the forecasts and assimilations 
carefully, to catch errors earlier in the development process.
We highly recommend using observation space diagnostics.

Once you are comfortable with those procedures,
you may find it more efficient to use setup_advanced,
which combines the setup of CAM and the activation of
the assimilation.  It also provides more advanced mechanisms
for setting up the best assimilation for your research.

The CESM environment, which DART requires, is now included
in CESM's "pre-beta" tests.  So you should be able to use
any beta, or higher, release of CESM (after 2.0) with DART.
We recommend that you set up a new shell_scripts/cesm#_#
directory, modeled on the cesm2_0, in order to maximize
the clarity in the scripting environment. 
If you discover that CESM is not playing well with DART,
and you have tried the simple fixes (increasing nodes/member,
decreasing ensemble size, removing your SourceMods, ...)
please contact us.
