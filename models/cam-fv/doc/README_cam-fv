We recommend that before using the DART CAM-FV interface
you become familiar with DART by working through 
the core parts of the DART tutorial or getting instruction 
from someone knowledgable about DART.

The scripts which set up CAM and CAM-DART assimilations 
are in the models/cam-fv/shell_scripts/cesm2_0 directory.
Work through setup_hybrid first, which will guide you 
through setting up the multi-instance CAM-FV environment 
which DART requires.

That script includes instructions for activating the 
assimilation using the DART_config script.
Check the output of the forecasts and assimilations 
carefully to catch errors early in the development process.
We highly recommend using observation space diagnostics
to evaluate your results.

Once you are comfortable with these procedures you may 
find it more efficient to use the setup_advanced script, 
which combines the setup of CAM and the activation of the
assimilation.  It also provides more advanced mechanisms
for setting up the best assimilation for your research.

The CESM environment which DART requires is now included
in CESM's testing process.  So you should be able to use
any new releases or any betas after CESM 2.0 with DART.
For releases or betas other than CESM 2.0 we recommend
setting up a new models/cam-fv/shell_scripts/cesm#_#
directory, modeled on the cesm2_0 directory, to minimize
problems with changing CESM requirements.

If you discover that CESM is not playing well with DART
and you have tried the simple fixes (increasing nodes/member,
decreasing ensemble size, removing your SourceMods, etc)
please contact us at dart@ucar.edu.
