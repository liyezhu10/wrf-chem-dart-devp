To get started with the WRF/DART tutorial, users need to obtain two things:
  1) Clone the DART repository
     $ git clone https://github.com/NCAR/DART

     You will need the DART code as well as the tutorial template files that are provided in DART/models/wrf/tutorial/template
     
  2) Download the pre-packaged data for the tutorial
     $ wget https://www.image.ucar.edu/wrfdart/tutorial/wrf_dart_tutorial_23May2018_v3.tar.gz (KRF: New data not there yet)

     This provides you with the input, perturbation, and observation data required to run the tutorial.  


Follow the directions for the tutorial at: https://www.image.ucar.edu/wrfdart/tutorial  (KRF: currently old instructions are live. new ones at models/wrf/tutorial/index.html of wrfdart_tutorial branch)

Disclaimers:

This tutorial is provided as guidance for setting up a basic WRF/DART experiment. It is designed to get the user familiar with the primary components and workflow.  Users should be aware that when moving to their own data/experiments, changes to the scripts or workflow will be required to fit their particular requirements and needs. 

Scripts here have been designed for use on a supercomputer with PBS queueing system (namely, Cheyenne). Users with different resources may need to make addtional changes to work on their particular system. E.g. see "NOTE" in driver.csh for submitting prep_ic.csh.
