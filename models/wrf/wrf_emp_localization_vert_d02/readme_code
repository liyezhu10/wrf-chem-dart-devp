wrf_emp_localization.f90_horiz_vert
   original code for real obs locations, with both horiz and vert localization options

wrf_emp_localization.f90_rad
   original code for real obs locations, distance is computed by radiance

wrf_emp_lcoalization.f90_meter
   original code for real obs locations, distance is computed by meter

wrf_emp_localization.f90_integralobs
   for real obs locations, but use truth of observation instead of observation values.
   this is the integral of obs, in order to reduce noise

wrf_emp_localization.f90_integralobs_conf
   for real obs locations, use truth of observations, 
   also compute the confidece value (group filter paper) of the alpha (localization)

wrf_emp_lcoalization.f90_allobs_U10U
   for SFC obs at each grid point, for U10 obs to U variable

wrf_emp_localization.f90_allobs
   for SFC obs at each grid points, for all SFC obs types and all 3D state variables

wrf_emp_localization.f90_allobs_q
   the same as 'wrf_emp_localization.f90_allobs', but adding obs type of 'specific humidity',
   to check how different from assimilating 'dewpoint' to 'specific humidity'

   Glen's comments: LH error method assigns larger error for drier air,
                    for a winter case, dewpoint maybe not a good choice...

wrf_emp_localization.f90_allobs_d01
   the same as 'wrf_emp_localization.f90_allobs_q',
   but fix the bug of spread when interpolating variables from non-mass grid points to mass grid points,
   also add the computation of abs(corrlation) and output it.
