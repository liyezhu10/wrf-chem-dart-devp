Start of scripts for controlling an experiment.

The main script is 'run_experiment.csh'.  It has the outer loop
which alternates between calling filter and the model advances.

The strategy is to have a 'template' file for each step of the
process, and have the main script use 'sed' to substitute for
the number of ensemble members, the current time, any job control
settings, etc and produce a 'job' file that's suitable for
submitting to the batch system.
