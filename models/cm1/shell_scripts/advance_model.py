# Script for use in assimilation applications
# where the model advance is executed as a separate process.
#
# Arguments are (created by 'filter' or 'perfect_model_obs' and include):
# 1) the process number of caller,
# 2) the number of ensemble members/state copies belonging to that process, and
# 3) the name of the control_file for that process.
#
# If this script finishes and the 'control_file' still exists, it is
# an ERROR CONDITION and means one or more of the ensemble members did
# not advance properly. Despite our best attempts to trap on this
# condition, some MPI installations simply hang, some properly terminate.
#
# This script loops over all the entries in the control_file to advance
# any/all of the ensemble members.  The number of trips through the
# loop is the second argument to this script. The control_file contains
# the information about which ensemble members are to be advanced by THIS TASK.
# Sometimes it may be just one ensemble member, sometimes all of them.
# Read DART/doc/html/filter_async_modes.html and the mpi_intro.html
# for an overview.
#
# This script has 4 logical 'blocks':
# 1) determine how many ensemble members (num_states) this process 
#    will need to advance.
# 2) convey the forecast length to the model
# 3) run the model (make the forecast)
# 4) determine if there are more ensemble members to advance
