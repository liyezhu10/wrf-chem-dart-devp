#
# This script is meant to provide an example of what is necessary to set up
# a very simple experiment that involves DART and a very small ensemble of
# CM1 model states. This is guaranteed to be scientifically bogus - it is just
# a test of the file motion and mechanics.
#
# ASSUMPTIONS/REQUIREMENTS
#
# *) CM1 is required to be compiled *without* MPI so we can run in async==2
#
# *) CM1 is required to use netCDF restart files.
#
# *) A collection of CM1 model states will be available. Each of those
#    model states is required to have its own namelist.input, LANDUSE.TBL,
#    etc. Each set of states and resources will be in a separate directory
#    named for each ensemble member ... i.e.  xxx/m1/* xxx/m2/* xxx/m3/* ...
#
# *) The DART obs_seq.out file will totally define the duration
#    of the assimilation.
#
# *) The DART input.nml file has some required values as defined below.
#
# *) Each time CM1 is advanced, it will start from the same filename,
#    and the restart number in that filename will be 000001 - ALWAYS.
#    That filename will be a link to the most current model state.
#
# *) Each time CM1 has finished advancing the most current restart file
#    will be renamed to have the valid date/time of the model state.
#

# These are the DART namelist variables that must have these values.
