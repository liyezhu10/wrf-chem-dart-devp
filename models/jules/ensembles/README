The ensembles (40) are generated from a single JULES restart file (./original_restart.nc). 
The restart file is the result of a point scale JULES spinup run (20 cycles over the year 2014). 
JULES namelist files for this run can be found in the ./namelist directiry. 
Only soil moisture (sthuf) is perturbed to generate the ensembles.
