Preamble: This file contains a list of tasks that Tim, Rafael, and Shams identified. 
The idea is that whomever decides to work on the issue will put their initials in front
of the item in the list. This will prevent duplication of effort. I took the liberty
of assigning everyone a task - for an example. This list is by no means complete.
Feel free to add to the list as you see fit.
