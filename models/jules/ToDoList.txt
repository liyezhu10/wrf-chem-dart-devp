Preamble: This file contains a list of tasks that Tim, Rafael, and Shams identified. 
The idea is that whomever decides to work on the issue will put their initials in front
of the item in the list. This will prevent duplication of effort. I took the liberty
of assigning everyone a task - for an example. This list is by no means complete.
Feel free to add to the list as you see fit.


Checklist DART-JULES   (XX means DONE)

- SR - Divide perfect_model.csh into a setup_pmo.csh and a run_pmo.csh (Comment: done, checked)
- SR - Establish a pool of ensemble members with instance names and 
          dates in the expected form along with appropriate sets of JULES 
          namelists and supporting resource files (e.g., mask file)
          RESOLVED: Shams created a Nx=3,Ny=5, Nlon=14,Nlat=1 case
                    'ensembles_synthetic_test_case'
- SR - Build setup_filter.csh and run_filter.csh  
- RR - Update COSMIC code into DART 
-    - Write matlab scripts for visualization 
-    - Write model_mod.html (documentation) 
-    - Write model interpolate code 
-    - Prune out unused variables 
- TH - Download and run JULES on yellowstone 
-    - Update the state-space Matlab scripts to support JULES 
-    - Make sure the script exit strategy works with the link options in use 
-    - Add JULES namelists to the diagnostic file output 
- SR - to test new advance_model.csh with JULES (Comment: new advance_model.csh works fine) 
- RR - Check FIXME along codes

Questions for 27 Aug:

*) Is it required to have a land mask when nx=ny=1? Ans: NO.

*) The synthetic_test_case is interesting ... the static_input.nc file has 'full' lat/lon arrays,
   i.e. x = 3, y = 5 ... the jules_restart.nc is 'land=14' I suspect the jules_output.nc has X=14,Y=1
   ANS: model_grid_nml:land_only= true/false controls this behavior
   
*) the files in data/namelist should be moved to one of the run_id directories - or - 
   the run_id directories should be populated with appropriate namelists and netCDF files
   and the files in data/namelist should be deleted.
   ANS: Everything gets piled into one directory - namelists mention local filenames.
   The restart/output files get names like:
   ensemble.dump.0001.20140101.00000.nc
   ensemble.hour.0001.20140101.00000.nc
   and all the 'static' data (land mask, tile fractions, etc.) get put into a single
   netCDF file - mentioned in ancillaries.nml and model_grid.nml

   Decided we should always use 
   model_grid.nml:jules_model_grid:land_only     = .true.         and
   model_grid.nml:jules_model_grid:force_1d_grid = .true.   
   to reduce permutations. The model grid will always be 'sparse', the input
   grids (containing the tile_fractions) will always be 2D - so a land mask
   will always be needed to resolve the two.  One nuisance - the
   restart files have dimension 'land' - the output file has dimension 'x',
   the land mask and tile fractions have dimensions Nx,Ny - but Nx is not 'x',
   and 'x' is 'land' ... bookkeeping nuisance in the DART diagnostic files.
