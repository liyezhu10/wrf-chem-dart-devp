There is at least one DART user who had working DART interface code
to the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system.
This model is supported and developed by the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) in North Carolina.

See here:

for more information on the model.  

If you are interested in running DART with this model please contact 
the DART group at 'dart@ucar.edu' for more information.  We currently do
not have a copy of the model_mod interface code nor any of the scripting 
required to run an assimilation, but we may be able to put you in contact 
with the right people to get it.
