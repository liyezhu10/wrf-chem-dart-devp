Observations:

For preparing observations of GPS Ionosphere profiles,
go to observations/obs_converters/gps/work.  the executable
is convert_gps_ionosphere.  the easiest workflow is to
doneload a day of profiles at a time and convert them
all at once into a single output file. then in the
shell_scripts directory is a script to break them up
into separate files containing only 10 minute intervals
of obs (can be configured to have whatever frequency is wanted).
