# This script has 4 logical 'blocks':
# 1) creates a clean, temporary directory in which to run a model instance 
#    and copies the necessary files into the temporary directory
# 2) converts the DART output to input expected by the CABLE model
# 3) runs CABLE 
# 4) converts the CABLE model output to input expected by DART
#
# The error code from the script reflects which block it failed.
