There are users developing a DART interface to the Community
Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model.
This model is a joint effort of the Australian Bureau of
Meterology and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organization (CISRO).

See here:

for more information on the model.  

If you are interested in running DART with this model please contact 
the DART group at 'dart@ucar.edu' for more information.  We have
prototype code and can put you in contact with the right people
to get more information about it.
